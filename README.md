* 18/09/2025: üî• Table2LaTeX-RL has been accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

## üöÄ TL;DR

</p>

**Table2LaTeX-RL** is a reinforced multimodal LLM framework that optimizes both structural and visual rewards to accurately generate LaTeX code from complex table images.

üéØ**Key contributions of our work**:

Problem insight: We address the challenging, practical table-image-to-LaTeX conversion task and analyze its unique difficulties in depth.

MLLM-based pipeline & insight: We integrate large-scale SFT with RL, achieving strong in- and out-of-domain performance, and reveal that MLLMs can excel on tasks with substantial domain gaps from typical vision-to-language problems when paired with targeted fine-tuning and RL.

Novel RL strategy ‚Äî VSGRPO: Our Visual‚ÄìStructural Guided RL jointly optimizes visual quality and structural fidelity via two complementary rewards, going beyond rule-based textual correctness checks and making it well-suited for layout-and-content sensitive tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
### (Step1) Install && Training

We recommend using Docker for code training. The configuration steps are as follows:
```bash
1. Pull the docker image. [Docker Image](docker pull modelscope-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/modelscope-repo/modelscope:ubuntu22.04-cuda12.6.3-py311-torch2.7.1-vllm0.10.1.1-modelscope1.29.2-swift3.8.1)

2. Run the docker image.(docker run --gpus all --ipc=host --network=host --name swift-grpo \
-v /home/code:/code \
-v /home/Datasets:/data \
-it [modelscope-registry.cn-hangzhou.cr.aliyuncs.com/modelscope-repo/modelscope:ubuntu22.04-cuda12.6.3-py311-torch2.7.1-vllm0.10.1.1-modelscope1.29.2-swift3.8.1] bash)

3. Install the required dependencies. (pip install -U trl && pip install table_recognition_metric && pip install -e .)

4. Run the code. (sh examples/train/grpo/plugin/run_external_rm.sh)
```
